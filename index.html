        The history of video games begins in the late 1950s. In 1958, physicist William Higinbotham created Tennis for Two
        on an oscilloscope at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The game was simple—a tennis-like
        simulation where two players used controllers with knobs and buttons to hit a ball back and
        forth across the screen.<br><br>
        Although it was never sold commercially, Tennis for Two is often considered the first true video game because it was interactive, used a display, and was built purely for entertainment. Shortly after, other pioneering games like Spacewar! (1962) and Pong (1972) carried the medium into wider popularity, laying the foundation for the massive gaming industry we know today.
